# React on Rails â€” A Tutorial

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/klawrence/blogging.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/klawrence/blogging)

## Where Do We Come From?
This started out as a learning exercise for me and morphed into a React tutorial
for Rails developers somewhere along the way.

If you know Rails well but are just getting started with React, 
the ideas in this project will set you on the right track.

There's a companion tutorial at 

### [Diamond Sky - React on Rails](https://www.diamond-sky.com/2020/10/react-on-rails/)

## What Are We?
The tutorial walks us through the steps to create a React app with a Rails back end
using Test Driven Development.

Along the way, we will learn to

* configure React on Rails
* learn the basics of building a react component 
   * properties, state and lifecycle and such.
* write tests with Jest & Enzyme.
* set up continuous integration on CircleCI.
* deploy our app on Heroku
* deliver data from Rails to React.
* send events from React back to Rails.

At the end of it, we might have a working blogging platform.
  
## Where Are We Going?
I started this project because I was frustrated with Redux's approach 
to state management and because, after 25 years of object-oriented programming,
I don't feel comfortable using the functional style. 

I want to see if I can make something that does the job that Redux does but uses
an objected-oriented design; something that would feel more natural to Rails developers.

Will I get there? You'll know when I know.

For now, this is more concept art than serious design. 
If I like what I see at the end of it, I'll try again with feeling.
Or maybe someone else will.
