## Thoughts
- Use rails actions names for API
- Keep track of load status of models
- Add methods to models so you can call back
- Manage a dispatch list

## Remote

## Gems
- react to sorcery

## React to Rails
### API
- Create 
- Update
- Index
- Fetch an association (eg post.author)
- use rails routes to build urls (put them in the JSON file, REST-style?)

### Config
- Use the rails locale file

### Initialization
Rake task should initialize the application component
```
rails react:initialize
```
Rails generator should create a component
```
rails g react Post 
```
